    "The code ensures that augmented photographs will be stored in a directory called \"translation.\" Then, it defines the translate_image() function, which translates images based on the specified offsets using first principles of image processing. This function shifts each pixel of the image by the given displacement in the x and y directions. It calculates the new coordinates of each pixel after translation and assigns the pixel value to the corresponding location in the translated image. The translated image is returned by the function. Following this, a list of translation offsets ranging from (-60, -60) to (60, 60) pixels is established.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, a set of augmented images is generated for each image by applying translation to the images according to the specified list of offsets. These translated images are saved in the 'translation' directory. Finally, the augmented images are displayed in a grid format, showcasing the original images alongside their translated versions with different offsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final adjustments to the translation offsets will determine the displacement of the photographs. Positive values shift the image to the right (in the x-direction) or downwards (in the y-direction), while negative values shift it to the left or upwards, respectively. A value of (0, 0) will leave the image unchanged. The magnitude of the offsets determines the extent of translation, with larger values resulting in more significant shifts."
